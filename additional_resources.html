			<h3>Additional Resources</h3>
			<p>As you have gone through this course you may of had some ideas to add on to your game, or even to make a whole new game! Of course, you may not of known how to implentent it, or perhaps you did not have the art or music you wanted. Either way, this course unfortunately has to come to an end. But to send you off, I wanted to provide as many resources I could for free assets, tutorials and programs I use to create my own art and music. Hopefully using these you can continue exploring game development on your own time.</p>
			<h4>Premade Assets</h4>
			<p>Nobody is great at everything. There is nothing wrong with using assets made by other people (just make sure to not plaguarize.) Here is a solid list of sites that provide both free and paid assets for games and other projects.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.kenney.nl/assets" target="_blank">Kenney<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>A truly incredible resource. Packed with high quality assets, tools, sounds and even a couple starter kits, Kenney's assets are some of the highest quality and complete free assets you can find (I cannot recommend enough going through them and seeing what inspires you.)</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://itch.io/game-assets" target="_blank">Itch.io<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>One of the best game development communities out there, Itch.io is an online game and game asset store that also serves as a hosting site for game jams (short game making competitions.) There are near endless amounts of free and paid assets for game development, and I can't understate how nice it is to have such a well made platform for developers to share and sell assets.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://opengameart.org/" target="_blank">OpenGameArt.org<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>Another game development community with tons of free assets, OpenGameArt is even more community focused with forums and discord channels, though I don't usually use it as I have a hard time finding what I am looking for a lot of the time.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/" target="_blank">Pixabay<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>A site full of royalty free sounds, I actually used this site to find all of the base sounds I used in this course. Full of high quality sound effects, what you can't find directly you can usually edit to make what you need.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset" target="_blank">Godot Asset Library<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>A bit different from the rest, the Godot asset library is a library of free tools and features you can use in your Godot projects. There are so many and I haven't messed with many, but there are a lot of exciting possibilities (also note that you can access the asset library directly in Godot by selecting the asset library screen.)</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p7nq1mwo_H3OeOks60P1RyR8Yosre2sC?usp=sharing" target="_blank">This Course's Unused Assets<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>Found in your VGDC-2025 Assets folder, you can find the resting place for all the assets I had to cut from this course due to complexity and time restraints. May they find a new home in your projects.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Art Creation Tools</h4>
			<p>If you are interested in making your own artwork for your games, it can be pretty easy to get started using these tools.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/" target="_blank">Piskel<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>A free, in-browser sprite creator, I used Piskel to make all of the sprites for this course. My recommended starting point as quite frankly it's very beginner friendly and non-commital.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">Gimp<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>A free alternative to programs such as photoshop, Gimp is open source and free to download. Unfortunately it is also quite complicated, but if you want to have access to some of the best tools for free, Gimp is a solid option.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://krita.org/en/" target="_blank">Krita<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>A free and open source painting program, Krita is more often used to make digital paintings. That being said, some of the most beautiful games I have ever played have had hand painted sprites and levels. Not for beginners to art, but incredibly powerful if you already have some practice.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" target="_blank">Asesprite<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>The only paid program I am putting on this list. Asesprite is <i>the</i> program for dedicated pixel artists. It is the standard that all others are compared to. I have been using Asesprite for over a decade now and while you can (quite effectively) use free alternatives, there is a reason why all the pixel art tutorials you see online use this program.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Music and Sound Creation Tools</h4>
			<p>Games aren't the same without some music and sounds. Fortunately there are many free ways to make some tunes and effects yourself!</p>
			<ul>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/download/" target="_blank">Audacity<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>A free and open source audio editor and recorder. Truly an amazing software, I used it to edit every sound and song in this course to get them just right. With tons of appliable effects and ways to cut, copy and fuse sounds, audacity is core to any sound design you end up doing.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/" target="_blank">Garageband<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>Free to Mac and Apple users, garageband is an incredibly powerful song creation tool with built in loops and instruments. Though if you aren't using apple products, you'll have to look elsewhere.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://musescore.org/en/download" target="_blank">Musecore 4<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>My preferred music creation software, Musescore 4 is a free open source software that is incredibly powerful, though requires knowledge on how to read and write sheet music to be able to use. Every song in this course was written in Musescore.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://sfxr.me/" target="_blank">JSFXR<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>Despite the mouthful of a name, JSFXR is really dead simple. It is a free in-browser sound generator made to quickly and easily make retro style sounds. I used it for all of the retro sounds in this course.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/" target="_blank">Chrome Music Lab<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>While designed as more of an educational tool, the song maker in the chrome music lab can be used as a truly beginner friendly start to begin making music (plus, it's just fun to mess around with.)</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Further Learning</h4>
			<p>This course isn't the end, it's only the beginning. Here are some of my favorite places to learn more about Godot and game development in general!</p>
			<ul>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@uheartbeast" target="_blank">Heartbeast<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>The first youtuber I started watching on my own game development journey, even over a decade later he is still creating wonderful tutorials.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA" target="_blank">Brackeys<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>An incredible youtube channel full of useful tutorials. While he left the scene for a couple years, he has begun to create new tutorials on Godot. There aren't many yet, but if you want to explore other engines like Unity, he's a great place to start.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw" target="_blank">Game Maker's Toolkit<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>While not a tutorial channel, Game Maker's Toolkit provides something a lot of tutorials lack: the reasons <i>why</i> developers do things. An excellent watch if you want to get a deeper intuition on game design itself beyond just the programming and art.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague" target="_blank">Sebastian Lague<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>While not many of his new videos are tutorials, or really even that deeply about game development, Sebastian Lague provides a look into some seriously complex topics on simulation and optimization in a fun and interesting way. Truly an excellent source of inspiration.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/" target="_blank">Godot recipes<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>A wonderful set of Godot specific tutorials and guides, it is an excellent place to get a better look at Godot or simply get inspired.</p></li>
				<li><div><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html" target="_blank">Godot Documentation<i class="linkbox bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></div>
					<p>The official documentation on Godot, it is full to bursting with in depth information and tutorials. It can be a bit overwhelming, but you will find yourself here plenty if you keep working with Godot.</p></li>
